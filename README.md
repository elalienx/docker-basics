# Docker Server Practice
The intention is to recreate the existing Word Cloud Project that takes an RSS feed and display the common words on a word cloud chart.

The Docker practice comes from the hosting it on AWS using Docker. One container for the backend that parses the RSS feed, another for the frontend that renders the word cloud, and a Docker compose file to handle both containers.
